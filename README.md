# ubccr-cms

This is taken mostly from Andrew Melo's [scripts that made this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/perilousapricot/cms-image-7). 
It is derived from the CENTOS7-based OSG worker-node Docker image [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensciencegrid/osg-wn/). 

This provides a Docker image with OSG WN software, and:
 - uproot
 - xrootd
 - python3.6
 - python2.7
